# A Haptic Toolkit for Fast Vibrotactile Prototyping

## Overview

A modular toolkit developed in Max/MSP for the rapid prototyping of audio-driven vibrotactile haptic effects. Designed to bridge the sensory gap in Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs), the toolkit enables users to create nuanced haptic feedback by manipulating parameters such as wave type, vibration duration, frequency, repetition, and envelope. The toolkit features a user-friendly graphical interface, allowing for intuitive design, storage, and management of haptic effects in buffers for output.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: A building-block approach with four main modules: Oscillator, Envelope, Automation, and Buffer.
- **Intuitive GUI**: Easily design and capture haptic effects with a simple graphical user interface.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly prototype and test haptic effects with audio-driven inputs.
- **Versatile Application**: Enhance a wide range of DMIs with customizable vibrotactile feedback.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone this repository to your local machine and open the project in Max/MSP.
2. **Modules Overview**: Familiarize yourself with the four modules (Oscillator, Envelope, Automation, Buffer) through the provided documentation.
3. **Creating Haptic Effects**: Start designing your haptic effects by adjusting parameters and using the "Trigger Record" button to capture your designs into the editing buffer.
4. **Output and Testing**: Connect the output to a voice coil or similar actuator to test the physical sensation of the designed vibrotactile feedback.

## Example Applications

- **Tactile Tremolo**: Demonstration of creating a tactile tremolo effect using a 250Hz sine wave and modulation over a one-second period.
- **Augmented Touché Controller**: Enhancing the Touché controller with vibrotactile feedback to provide an added dimension of control through touch-sensitive feedback.
- **Spatial Proximity**: Implementing a gradient of tactile feedback, increasing as one approaches a ridge and diminishing when moving away.
